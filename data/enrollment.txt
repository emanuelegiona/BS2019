The common hill myna, sometimes spelled "mynah" and formerly simply known as hill myna, is the myna most commonly seen in aviculture, where it is often simply referred to by the latter two names.
It is a member of the starling family, resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.
The Sri Lanka hill myna is now generally accepted as a separate species.
The common hill myna is often detected by its loud, shrill, descending whistles followed by other calls.
Both sexes can produce an extraordinarily wide range of loud calls, sometimes melodious and often very human-like in quality.
Unlike some other birds, the common hill myna does not imitate other birds in the wild, but they are among the most renowned mimics, perhaps on par only with the grey parrot.
They can learn to reproduce many everyday sounds, particularly the human voice, and even whistled tunes, with astonishing accuracy and clarity.
