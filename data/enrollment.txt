The common hill myna, sometimes spelled "mynah" and formerly simply known as hill myna, is the myna most commonly seen in aviculture, where it is often simply referred to by the latter two names.
It is a member of the starling family, resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.
The Sri Lanka hill myna is now generally accepted as a separate species.
This is a stocky jet-black myna, with bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin and fleshy wattles on the side of its head and nape. At about 29 cm length, it is somewhat larger than the common myna.
It is overall green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. Its large, white wing patches are obvious in flight, but mostly covered when the bird is sitting.
The bill and strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on the nape and under the eye.
The common hill myna is often detected by its loud, shrill, descending whistles followed by other calls.
Both sexes can produce an extraordinarily wide range of loud calls, sometimes melodious and often very human-like in quality.
Unlike some other birds, the common hill myna does not imitate other birds in the wild, but they are among the most renowned mimics, perhaps on par only with the grey parrot.
They can learn to reproduce many everyday sounds, particularly the human voice, and even whistled tunes, with astonishing accuracy and clarity.
